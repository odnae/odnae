ODNAE: Ontology of Drug Neuropathy Adverse Events

ODNAE is a biomedical ontology that represents the drug-associated neuropathy adverse events, the associated drugs, and their relatiosn. ODNAE extends the Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE).

ODNAE is designed as an effective platform of a drug-induced neuropathy knowledge base and for analyzing the underlying mechanisms of drug-induced neuropathy.
